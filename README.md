# happy_valley_kennels

This is a mock website for an imaginary dog kennel. The idea came from an old school project I did when I completed my Computer Science program!

This is still a work in progress, but will allow users to create an account (with a profile picture), login, add pets (including pet profile pictures),
view their dashboard and so on.

  As of today, users can create an account and login. The dashboard is still in progress. Currently working on the design of the website. 

NOTE: If you are an employer and are looking at the timeline of how long it took me to create this website, please keep in mind that I was juggling this project along with a full time job, going to the gym, wedding planning, and other obligations :)
